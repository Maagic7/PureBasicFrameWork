PureBasic Framework
It's  mostly in Beta or Brainstorming State
See comments in Module Code for the actual relase State!
Do not use any code in your projects until you tested it!
 
NEW:
Some Parts of the PLC Library become useable.
Now the \PLC\PbFw_Module_S7.pb can be used for testing.
It is a Library for DataType handling of the Siemens S7 PLC's
S7300/400. Should work for TIA Portal too. But I did not test it
with TIA until now. But if you want to use the functions with DB read/write
Buffer you have to be sure that the DB's are not 'optimized'.

Some Module descriptions of \Modules
PbFw_ASM_Macros.pbi : Collection of Assembler optimation Macros	
                      now with many SEE optimation Macros
					  
PbFw_Module_Bit     : optimized Bit manipulation functions

PbFw_Module_CodeCreation  : Helper Functions for Creating PB-Code and copy it to ClipBoard
PbFw_Module_Complex       : Module for Math with complex numbers
PbFw_Module_CPU           : CPU indentification and Feature Flags
                            including exact Core Frequency detection

PbFw_Module_DbCodeCreation: DataBase CodeCreation Module

PbFw_Module_FileSystem : File-System Functions

PbFW_Module_PX		: PureBasic Command extention. Add missing commands: 
                      Min, Max,.., ElapsedMicrosenconds/Nanoseconds, Color Macros
					  SplitString, JoinString, TextBetween. Advanced String parsing Macros

PbFw_Module_Prime   : fast 64Bit Prime Number Test and Prime Factorisation
                      using Modulo(30) distance for reducing caclculations

PbFw_Module_Phonetics: Phonetic algorithms which assigns to words a sequence of digits,
                       the phonetic code. The aim of this function ist that identical sounding
                       words have the same code assigned to them.
					   Soundex algorithm: is the most common used and well adapted to english.
                       Cologne Phonetic algorithm is adapted to match the German language.			   
					   
PbFW_Module_Roman   : Converter for Roman Numbers

PbFw_Module_STL       : A STL-File-Format importer (3D Grafics)
PbFw_Module_StringSSE : Ultra fast String Functions using SSE 
 
PbFw_Module_VisualBasic : nearly all VisualBasic6 Constants
PbFw_Module_VECTORf : SSE optimized float Vector operations (3D Grafics)
PbFw_Module_VECTORd : SSE optimized double Vector operations (3D Grafics)
